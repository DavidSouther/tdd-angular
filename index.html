	<p class="lead">This is a todo app! There are many like it, but this one was written from nothing following as best I was able TDD design processes. Built entirely using Javascript technologies, it also provides a great practical example of how a variety of modern NodeJS tools work together to build a modern app.</p>

		<p>In this walkthrough, I'll be pulling out interesting changes from the git logs of the tdd-angular project. The entire code is on <a href="https://github.com/DavidSouther/tdd-angular">github</a>. Each commit with an interesting change has a short hash, commit message, and some of the diff.</p>

		<h3>Quick Roadmap</h3>
		<p>We'll be starting with the first bootstrap - going from an empty folder to a "hello world". In this app, it will be an HTML page. Along the way, we'll put in place the core of our functional testing suite, which will drive our high-level application needs, and some tools for testing the underlying server.</p>

		<p>With a base server in place, we'll start working on building out the initial application logic. The client will use AngularJS, and will give us a good chance to exercise Selnium Webdriver JS Bindings.</p>

		<p>After getting a tiny application, we'll iterate quickly on adding styling and some basic features to get to a minimum viable product (MVP) that saves, adds, and removes todos.</p>

		<p>With the MVP, we can set up continuous integration and deployment. Then, it's off to the races!</p>
